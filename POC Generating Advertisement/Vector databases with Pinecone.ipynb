    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "This repository contains Python code for indexing and querying a dataset of tourist destinations using Pinecone, a vector database service. The dataset includes information about various destinations along with their categories and descriptions. Additionally, the code demonstrates how to use Sentence Transformers to create embeddings for textual data, facilitating similarity search within the dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Requirements\n",
    "\n",
    "Before running the code, ensure you have the following dependencies installed:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Python 3.x\n",
    "- pandas\n",
    "- sentence-transformers\n",
    "- tqdm\n",
    "- Pinecone\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Usage\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Set up Pinecone: Obtain an API key from Pinecone and replace the placeholder in the code with your API key:\n",
    "\n",
    "    ```python\n",
    "    pc = Pinecone(api_key=\"YOUR_API_KEY_HERE\")\n",
    "    index = pc.Index(\"tourist-index\")\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Prepare the dataset: Modify the `dataset` variable to include the desired tourist destinations, categories, and descriptions.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Run the indexing code: Execute the Python script or Jupyter notebook containing the provided code snippets to index the dataset into Pinecone.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Perform queries: Use the `run_query` function to search for destinations based on a query.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Functionality\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Dataset Indexing**: The code indexes a dataset of tourist destinations into Pinecone, associating each destination with its respective metadata and embedding.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Text Embedding**: Sentence Transformers are utilized to generate embeddings for the textual descriptions of tourist destinations.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Similarity Search**: Pinecone allows for efficient similarity search based on embeddings, enabling the retrieval of destinations similar to a given query.\n",
