    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "This repository contains code for a demonstration of using Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) for generating advertisements targeting travelers. The code utilizes Pinecone vector database for similarity search, Sentence Transformers for generating embeddings, and Replicate for fine-tuning and generating text based on the provided context.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Requirements\n",
    "\n",
    "Before running the code, make sure you have the following dependencies installed:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Python 3.x\n",
    "- Pinecone\n",
    "- Sentence Transformers\n",
    "- Replicate\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Usage\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Set up Pinecone: Obtain an API key from Pinecone and replace the empty string in the code with your API key:\n",
    "\n",
    "    ```python\n",
    "    pc = Pinecone(api_key=\"YOUR_API_KEY_HERE\")\n",
    "    index = pc.Index(\"tourist-index\")\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Set up Replicate: Set your Replicate API token as an environment variable:\n",
    "\n",
    "    ```bash\n",
    "    export REPLICATE_API_TOKEN=\"YOUR_API_TOKEN_HERE\"\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Run the code: Execute the Python script or Jupyter notebook containing the provided code snippets.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Functionality\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Similarity Search**: The code performs similarity search using Pinecone, allowing you to find relevant context based on a given query.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Text Embedding**: Sentence Transformers are used to generate embeddings for the input text.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Text Generation**: Replicate is utilized for generating engaging advertisements targeted at travelers based on the context retrieved from the similarity search.\n",
    "\n",
