# Learning GenerativeAI 

Fine-tune an existing Language Model (LLM) from Hugging Face for enhanced dialogue summarization. To improve inferences, the model is fully fine-tuned and evaluated with ROUGE metrics. Later, PEFT fine-tuning is performed, and the resulting model is evaluated to observe that the benefits of PEFT outweigh slightly lower performance metrics.
